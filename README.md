# WunderPi
A Raspberry Pi + Wunderlist e-ink desktop to-do list

With the combination of a raspberry pi and a PaPiRus display, this app will allow you to create a to do list that can sit on your desk/bedside table which will always display all the To-Dos that you have yet to complete. Saves you getting distracted by your phone when picking it up to check your To-Dos.
